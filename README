There are some issues with the meter of P4. You need to check which branch(version) of ONOS do you use, then modify some code. 
1. ONOS cannot read the meter from the P4 switch until now. (https://jira.onosproject.org/projects/ONOS/issues/ONOS-7720?filter=allopenissues)
2. Therefore, ONF comments to turn off the meter usage (https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos/blob/master/drivers/p4runtime/src/main/resources/p4runtime-drivers.xml)
So, I think you need to uncomment the code of "behaviour api="org.onosproject.net.meter.MeterProgrammable......" in p4runtime-drivers.xml.
Then, I think you can configure the meter in the P4 switch. However, you still cannot read the meter from the P4 switch.
